The commit history in this repository is sort of (really) messed up, so don't pay much attention to it. In order to run the classifier, just clone the repo, and run "RunThis.jar".


NOTE:

Application is configured and run via a GUI, and not via the command line. Therefore, the instruction
format of this README file is not in the typical Linux format as suggested, as this just makes it more
difficult to understand for a non-cmd application.

HOW TO RUN:

    To run the application, first unzip the zip file, and then launch the executable JAR file conveniently
    named “RunThis.jar”.

    When the “Start classification” button is pressed, the application will perform training calculations for
    several minutes and then display the results.

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:

    NOTE: It is very important not to move this file to any other directory.

    If there is a problem running the program with this JAR, the next best option would be to run the program
    through the main method of the “MainPanel” class in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc).
